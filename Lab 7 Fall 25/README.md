## Lab #7: CodeZen

Submitted by: **Ryan Lawton**

### Overview

In this lab, we'll take a break from the world of API programming and focus on another aspect of Android development: Making apps that are nice to look at!

Building off of what we learned in Unit 3, we're going to customize the CodeZen app, including new fonts, customized themes, and styles.

### 🎯 Goals

The basic version of the app will apply custom colors and fonts to the app and use themes and styles.

## Lab #5: Random Pets üê∂üê±

Submitted by: **Ryan Lawton**

### Overview

In this lab, you will build an app that shows random pet images from an API when the user taps a button. The main purpose of this lab is to understand how to call an API to receive data and use the data in your app.

The basic version of the app will allow the user to tap a button to display a random dog image retrieved from an API. Stretch features use images from two APIs and randomly chooses either a dog or a cat to display.

## Application Features
